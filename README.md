Knowledge Representation Techniques (KRT) @ RIT - XML Project

An XML/CSS/DTD/Schema based project, displaying the various movie times of various theatres in Rochester in September 2018.

Two parts to it:

1. XML creation. Validation of the XML document with the help of an DTD. A nice CSS for the same.
2. Using the same XML and CSS files, and XSD validation for the XML document.
